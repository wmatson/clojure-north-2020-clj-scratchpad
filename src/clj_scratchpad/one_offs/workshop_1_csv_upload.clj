  ;; It's 2 AM and a critical periodic data pull has failed, 
  ;; an analyst tried uploading the relevant file manually, 
  ;; but the upload form threw an exception.
  ;; 
  ;; The customer support line for the data source doesn't open
  ;; until 10AM local time, which is too late. It's up to you
  ;; to munge the data into a shape that works.
