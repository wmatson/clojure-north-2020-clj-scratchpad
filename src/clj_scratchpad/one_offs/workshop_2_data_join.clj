;; As the old monolith splits into shiny new microservices, it's
;; become harder to ask routine business intelligence questions.
;; 
;; After all, not all the data resides in one database together
;; anymore.
;; 
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; Here are some questions to answer:
;; 
;; What type of event is most effective at driving sales?
;;    - Please break this down by 20-year age groups (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, ...)
;;    - Please provide an answer in item quantity as well as gross proceeds
;; 
;; 
;; If the exercise is too easy, spend some time playing with streaming lazily
;; such that the full dataset never needs to sit in memory.
